                            <p>The stronger the exercise, or the harder the exercise, the more energy it requires. In general,
                                 aerobic exercise is called aerobic exercise, which is light enough to cover all the energy required
                                  by aerobic metabolism.
                                aerobic activity. Also known as aerobic exercise or aerobics. Aerobic exercise literally refers to
                                 exercise that produces energy using inhaled oxygen and performs it using that energy. When energy 
                                 is needed, aerobic metabolism goes through a complex process of breathing oxygen through the
                                  respiratory system and then transporting it to the muscles through the circulatory system to
                                   produce energy, and the capacity of this process is limited, so it lacks the ability to quickly
                                    supply a lot of energy at once.</p>

                    <h2>Muscular Exercise <i class="fa-solid fa-people-carry-box"></i> </h2>
                    <p>Muscular strength relates to your ability to move and lift objects. 
                        It’s measured by how much force you can exert and how much weight you can lift for a short period of time.
                        Examples of exercises that develop muscular strength and power include resistance training,
                         such as weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, and resistance band exercises. Running, cycling,
                          and climbing hills are also options.
                        Read on to learn more about the difference between muscular strength and muscular endurance,
                         as well as muscular strength benefits, cautions, and exercises.</p>

                        <h2>Jogging <i class="fa-solid fa-person-walking-arrow-right"></i> </h2>
                            <p>If you jog steadily, you will feel your legs such as thighs and calves strengthen and your 
                                basic physical strength will rise sharply. Moreover, running (running) such as jogging is an 
                                exercise that unexpectedly trains the upper body (3).
                                If an obese person who just started exercising maintains a posture and breathes evenly while 
                                exercising and jogging, that's why he gets muscle pain all over his body the next day.</p>
                                <p>Since I suddenly moved with an hour-long exercise, starting with the spinal cord standin
                                     muscles, the arm muscles and under the armpit, the thigh muscles and the shin muscles under
                                      the knee will scream the next day. There is a reason why running is always included in the 
                                      basic physical training course in any sport.[4]
                                    But let's not feel pressured. Jogging is a light running exercise. The standard speed of jogging
                                     is 45 seconds for 100 meters = 8 km/h [5]. It's only about twice the walking speed. The introduction
                                      mentioned that jogging is a sub-version of running, which has a standard speed of approximately
                                       200 meters per minute = 12 kilometers per hour.</p>

                                <p> A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position 
                                    and then stands back up. During the descent, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint
                                     dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when 
                                     standing up. Squats also help the hip muscles.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower
                                         body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during
                                          the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.</p>
