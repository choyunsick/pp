                    <h2>The need for exercise</h2>
                    <p>Every January, many people visit the gym. In the new year, people decide 
                        to exercise and challenge with a new mindset, but not many people succeed 
                        in the challenge. What can be gained through exercise is various such as health,
                         body shape management, achievement, and pleasure. The ultimate goal of exercising 
                         is health care, which is very effective, but is often ignorant of exactly how to exercise.
                        Usually, exercise is largely divided into aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise, which refers
                         to continuous exercise without stopping for at least 20 minutes. Typical examples include walking,
                          cycling, swimming, mountain climbing, and soccer.</p>

                          and the waste relationship can increase the amount of oxygen that can be inhaled into
                           the lungs to the maximum. Exercise has also been shown to have the following benefits.

                    <h2>An example of a sense of accomplishment</h2>
                    <p>3.9km swimming, 180.2km cycling, and 42.2km running. This is the "Iron Man" course, which is the most difficult
                         among triathlon. It is a breathtaking process that ordinary people cannot dare to dare to overcome human 
                         limitations. In fact, even those who exercise cannot hastily challenge without sufficient preparation.
                          However, there is a person who participates in such a fierce game every month. Kim Dong-wook (46), director
                           of Dell Korea, who stepped into the triathlon four years ago, is the main character.
                        As triathlon is not an exercise that anyone can do, there is a considerable sense of accomplishment and joy
                         when they achieve it. Director Kim's first game was the "Icheon Seolbong Iron Triathlon" held in Icheon,
                          Gyeonggi-do in July 2008. It was a time full of tension, excitement, and fear. Therefore, it is said that
                           he still vividly remembers how he felt at that time.
                        "When you finish, you can't even talk about joy. I felt like my heart was going to explode with the sense
                         of accomplishment and joy that I finally did it. But I was terrified throughout the game. It's a particularly
                          difficult course for swimming. Swimming is the most burdensome thing not only for me but also for other 
                          participants. When I practice, I don't have fear because I do it in a swimming pool with a clear view of
                           the floor, but in triathlon, I get scared because I do it in rivers, lakes, or seas where I can't see the 
                           bottom at all. Also, the water temperature suddenly changes, so I often give up halfway. After swimming, 
                           bicycles and marathons are waiting, especially on that day, the rain was drizzling, and all kinds of 
                           worries were filled in my head, "Would the bicycle slip and get hurt?" and "Would a heart attack while
                            running?" (laughs). But every time I did that, I was able to endure 17 hours (a kind of image training) 
                            imagining myself taking a warm shower and drinking cold beer after the game."
